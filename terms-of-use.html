                            <p>5. Description of the Service</p>
                            <p>Givingli provides a service for Users to send personalized digital greeting cards and the option for the recipient to redeem virtual credit towards digital gift cards.</p>
                            <p>A. Giving with Givingli</p>
                            <p>The Service is a platform that allows a person (the “Sender”) to buy a gift for another person (the “Recipient”). These terms apply to you as a Sender or as a Recipient.</p>
                            <p>
                                The Service provides the ability of the Recipient to redeem virtual currency (“Givingli Cash”) for one or more digital gift card products (each a “Product”) from one of the available participating merchants
                                (“Merchant”). The Service allows the Sender to select a digital greeting card (“Greeting”) and purchase Givingli Cash. The Service allows the Sender to suggest a Product for the Recipient to exchange for
                                Givingli Cash (“Redeem”). The Service will process the payment for Givingli Cash from the Sender and allow the Recipient to make his/her gift Redeem decision(s), at the Recipient’s option.
                            </p>
                            <p>B. Suggested Gift</p>
                            <p>
                                Givingli does not accept Payment for anything other than Givingli Cash, which may be Redeemed by the Recipient for Products. Recipient does not purchase anything using the Givingli Service and Givingli does
                                not sell Products, i.e. digital gift cards. The sole way for any User to obtain a Product is by Redeeming Givingli Cash in exchange for a Product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The Sender will pay an amount, as described below, for Givingli Cash (a “Payment”) by using a payment method offered through the Service (e.g., a credit card) (“Payment Method”). In connection with the
                                Payment the Sender may choose to suggest a Product for the Recipient to Redeem with their Givingli Cash (the “Suggested Gift”). The Sender does not purchase a Product, regardless of if Sender chooses a
                                Suggested Gift or not. Sender may only purchase Givingli Cash and under no circumstances does Givingli accept any money in exchange for a Product. Upon Payment, the Service makes available the Payment amount
                                to the Recipient (“Givingli Cash Value”). The Recipient may use the Givingli Cash Value to select the Suggested Gift or any other Product offered by the Givingli at that time, as offered to the Recipient by
                                the Service. When a Recipient uses the Givingli Cash Value to select one of these options, the selection is called the “Gift”. Each Payment is subject to Givingli’s fraud process and evaluation, which may
                                result in a rejection of the Payment (“Payment Rejection”). Payment Rejection for any reason, including but not limited to suspected fraud, will result in a full refund to the card-holder plus any applicable
                                fees. Givingli has sole discretion to reject any Payment for any reason or for no reason.
                            </p>
                            <p>C. Recipient Notice</p>
                            <p>
                                The Service will offer the Sender one or more mechanisms to provide the Recipient notice that the Recipient has received Givingli Cash Value from the Sender (“Recipient Notice”) which may include SMS text
                                message, email and/or social media communications. Depending on how the Sender chooses to provide the Recipient Notice, the Sender may be required to enter contact information for the Sender and/or the
                                Recipient. The Sender is solely responsible for sending the Recipient Notice. The Sender acknowledges that any person with access to the Recipient Notice or the Givingli Cash Value may be able to Redeem the
                                Givingli Cash Value, regardless of whether Sender intends such person to receive the Recipient Notice or the Givingli Cash Value. Givingli is not responsible for any incorrect contact or other information
                                provided by the Sender. If Givingli is informed that the contact information provided by the Sender is invalid (e.g., phone number of the Recipient is returned undeliverable), Givingli will make reasonable
                                efforts to contact the Sender to obtain updated contact information to resend the Givingli Cash Value.
                            </p>
                            <p>D. Using the Givingli Cash Value</p>
                            <p>
                                The Recipient Notice will inform the Recipient of the Sender’s Suggested Gift and a mechanism to access the Givingli Cash Value to obtain the Suggested Gift, if the Recipient chooses. The Recipient may Redeem
                                the Givingli Cash Value for the Suggested Gift or any other Product issued by another entity as offered to the Recipient by the Service. If the Recipient chooses to redeem the Givingli Cash Value for a
                                Product, such Product is priced at the time of the Givingli Cash Value redemption and is subject to availability. The use of Givingli Cash Value to Redeem for any Product is governed by the Merchant Terms.
                            </p>
                            <p>If the Recipient chooses to redeem the Givingli Cash Value for a Gift other than the Suggested Gift, Recipient may email Givingli at hello@Givingli.com to obtain a different gift.</p>
                            <p>E. Cancelling the Givingli Cash Value Transaction</p>
                            <p>The Givingli Cash Value transaction may be cancelled for the following reasons:</p>
                            <p>
                                (i) by Givingli or the Merchant as permitted by law, this Agreement, or Merchant Terms or in order to prevent fraud or money laundering or other illegal uses of the Service or uses that pose excessive legal,
                                financial or security risk to Givingli or its suppliers;
                            </p>
                            <p>(ii) by Givingli acting on behalf of the Sender, Merchant, or Recipient for the purposes set forth in this provision at Givingli’s sole discretion, or</p>
                            <p>(iii) as otherwise required or permitted by law.</p>
                            <p>
                                Upon cancellation of the Givingli Cash Value, the Service will notify the Sender and, if appropriate, the Recipient of the cancellation. Givingli will also issue a refund of the Sender’s original Payment
                                Method for the appropriate amount, if Givingli determines a refund is appropriate. We reserve the right to charge a fee to the Sender if Sender cancels the transaction and such fee, if any, will be disclosed
                                to Sender at time of cancellation request.
                            </p>
                            <p>F. Limitations</p>
                            <p>
                                The Sender may not use the Service to purchase any Givingli Cash Value with an aggregate value of greater than $2,000 on any single day. Some Merchants might have a lower daily and/or transactional
                                limitation.
                            </p>
                            <p>G. Fees</p>
                            <p>
                                We do not charge any activation, service, dormancy or inactivity fees in connection with Merchant Gift Card Products. Your Gift Card Products are subject to the Terms of each Merchant and have no expiration
                                date nor does the value on your Gift Card Product ever expire.
                            </p>
                            <p>H. The Merchant’s Responsibilities</p>
                            <p>
                                You acknowledge and agree that any stored value product issued in connection with the Service (e.g., Merchant gift card selected by Recipient) is issued only when the Recipient Redeems the Givingli Cash Value
                                for a gift card. You also acknowledge and agree that any such gift card is issued by the Merchant. You agree that the Merchant, and not Givingli, is solely responsible for any and all Merchant Terms or other
                                terms and conditions relating to Gifts, including, without limitation, the following: (i) Products provided by the Merchant, including price, advertising, providing accurate names, descriptions, and pictures,
                                fulfilling and shipping all orders for Products made by the Recipient, etc.; (ii) escheat and any unclaimed property issues regarding Products purchased or Merchant gift cards; (iii) complying with applicable
                                federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those regulating gift cards, gift certificates, stored value, and prepaid access issued by Merchants or any other third party; (iv) returns,
                                exchanges, defects, and any other issues regarding Products; and (v) redeeming Gifts directly if your access to the Service has been suspended or terminated or you are otherwise unable to use the Service. Any
                                questions or issues regarding order or shipment errors, returns, exchanges, defects or problems with the products or services provided by the Merchant, or any other issues that are the responsibility of the
                                Merchant should be directed to the Merchant, not Givingli. Any return or exchange of Product will be subject to the Merchant’s then-current return process or policy and Merchant Terms and any accepted returns
                                will result, as applicable, in a credit with or refund from the Merchant.<br />

                                not warrant that the Mobile Software will be compatible with your mobile device. Givingli hereby grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use a compiled code copy of the Mobile
                                Software for one Givingli account on one mobile device owned or leased solely by you, for your personal use. You may not: (i) modify, disassemble, decompile or reverse engineer the Mobile Software, except to
                                the extent that such restriction is expressly prohibited by law; (ii) rent, lease, loan, resell, sublicense, distribute or otherwise transfer the Mobile Software to any third party or use the Mobile Software
                                to provide time sharing or similar services for any third party; (iii) make any copies of the Mobile Software; (iv) remove, circumvent, disable, damage or otherwise interfere with security-related features of

                                electronically upgrade the version of the Mobile Software that you are using on your mobile device. You consent to such automatic upgrading on your mobile device, and agree that the terms and conditions of
                                this Agreement will apply to all such upgrades. You acknowledge that any failure to upgrade the Mobile Software may result in the inability to use all or part of the Mobile Software. You agree to pay, and you
                                acknowledge that you are solely liable for, any and all fees that result from your use of the Mobile Software, including without limitation, mobile carrier charges and/or Internet connection fees. You further
                                acknowledge that this Agreement does not apply to any third party software, sites, or services that you use in connection with the Mobile Software, and that you are solely liable for your use of or access to
                                any such third party services, whether or not such services are required to enable any features of the Mobile Software. Any third-party code that may be incorporated in the Mobile Software is covered by the
                                applicable open source or third-party license EULA, if any, authorizing use of such code. The foregoing license grant is not a sale of the Mobile Software or any copy thereof, and Givingli or its third party
                                partners or suppliers retain all right, title, and interest in the Mobile Software (and any copy thereof). Any attempt by you to transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder, except as
                                expressly provided for in this Agreement, is void. Givingli reserves all rights not expressly granted under this Agreement. If the Mobile Software is being acquired on behalf of the United States Government,
                                then the following provision applies. Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Mobile Software by the U.S. Government is subject to restrictions set forth in this Agreement and as provided in DFARS

                                States, and is subject to United States export laws and regulations. The Mobile Software may not be exported or re-exported to certain countries or those persons or entities prohibited from receiving exports
                                from the United States. In addition, the Mobile Software may be subject to the import and export laws of other countries. You agree to comply with all United States and foreign laws related to use of the
                                Mobile Software and the Givingli Service.

                                extent required by this Agreement. You and Givingli acknowledge and agree that Apple, and Apple’s subsidiaries, are third party beneficiaries of this Agreement as relates to your license of the Apple-Sourced
                                Software, and that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this Agreement as relates to your
                                license of the Apple-Sourced Software against you as a third party beneficiary thereof.

                                principles. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. You agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the federal and state
                                courts located in Los Angeles County, California for any actions for which we retain the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
                                threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property or proprietary rights, or any other exception set forth in
                                Section 16(D) below.

                                D. Exceptions to Negotiation and Arbitration. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Agreement, nothing in Sections 16(A) or 16(B) shall prevent either party from (i) seeking injunctive or
                                other equitable relief from the courts as necessary to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of that party’s data security, Intellectual Property Rights, or other
                                proprietary rights; (ii) pursuing any claims seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the validity of either party’s Intellectual Property Rights; (iii) pursuing any claim related to, or arising from,
                                allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy or unauthorized use; or (iv) any other claim for equitable relief. In addition to the foregoing, either party may assert an individual action in small claims
                                court for claims that are within the scope of such courts&#x27; jurisdiction in lieu of arbitration.

                            <p>
                                Any balance in your Givingli Cash account represents a virtual amount, that is not secured by an fiat currency, until Recipient Redeems for a Product. Funds held in a Givingli Cash account are not insured by
                                the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Givingli combines your Givingli Cash account balance with the balances of other Givingli Cash account holders and invests those funds in liquid investments in
                                accordance with state money transmitter laws. Givingli owns the interest or other earnings on these investments. However, the claim against Givingli represented by your Givingli Cash account balance is not
                                secured by these investments and you do not have any ownership interest (either legal or beneficial) in these investments. You are responsible for all risks associated with maintaining Givingli Cash. Givingli
                                may hold, cancel, or reverse any transaction we determine to violate this policy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have opened a Givingli Account, Givingli Cash sent by someone else to your personal Givingli account will automatically be placed in your Givingli Cash balance, creating a total of your unredeemed
                                Givingli Cash. If you receive Givingli Cash you may redeem it in the Givingli App or any other method offered to you by the Givingli Service. You may be required to create a Givingli Account in order to
                                Redeem Givingli Cash.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                A. Assignment. This Agreement, and any rights and licenses granted hereunder, may not be transferred or assigned by you, but may be assigned by Givingli without restriction. Any attempted transfer or
                                assignment in violation hereof shall be null and void.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                B. Notification Procedures and Changes to the Agreement. Givingli may provide notifications, whether such notifications are required by law or are for marketing or other business related purposes, to you via
                                email or SMS notice, written or hard copy notice, or through posting of such notice on our website, as determined by Givingli in our sole discretion. Givingli reserves the right to determine the form and
                                means of providing notifications to our Users, provided that you may opt out of certain means of notification as described in this Agreement. Givingli is not responsible for any automatic filtering you or
                                your network provider may apply to email notifications we send to the email address you provide us. Givingli may, in its sole discretion, modify or update this Agreement from time to time, and so you should
                                review this page periodically. When we change the Agreement in a material manner, we will update the ‘last modified’ date at the bottom of this page. Your continued use of the Service after any such change
                                constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms or any future Terms of Use, do not use or access (or continue to access) the Service.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                C. No Partnership. You agree that no joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Givingli as a result of this Agreement or your use of the Service.<br />
                                D. Attorneys’ Fees. In the event any litigation is brought by either party in connection with this Agreement, the prevailing party in such litigation shall be entitled to recover from the other party all the
                                reasonable costs, attorneys&#x27; fees and other expenses incurred by such prevailing party in the litigation.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                E. Equitable Remedies. You hereby agree that Givingli would be irreparably damaged if the terms of this Agreement were not specifically enforced, and therefore you agree that we shall be entitled, without
                                bond, other security, or proof of damages, to appropriate equitable remedies with respect to breaches of this Agreement, in addition to such other remedies as we may otherwise have available to us under
                                applicable laws.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                F. Entire Agreement/Severability. This Agreement, together with any amendments and any additional agreements you may enter into with Givingli in connection with the Service, shall constitute the entire
                                agreement between you and Givingli concerning the Service. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the
                                validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                G. No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Givingli’s failure to assert any right or provision under this
                                Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.
                            </p>
                            <p>
