                                <strong>​</strong>GIVINGLI may use personal information in order to facilitate your use of the GIVINGLI Services, including receiving, processing, fulfilling and delivering your purchases. We may use personal
                                information to identify you when you log in to our GIVINGLI Services, to provide a better experience through the GIVINGLI Services, or to personalize your experience across the GIVINGLI Services. We may also
                                use personal information to better understand our customers and to better tailor or enhance our GIVINGLI Services. For example, we may also use personal information for data analysis and segmentation,
                                understanding our customers across our various platforms and brands, and providing recommendations and reminders for events and other business purposes. We may also use personal information as we believe to
                                be necessary or appropriate to protect our rights, privacy, safety or property, and/or that of our affiliated companies, you or others, and to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that
                                we may sustain.
                            </p>

                                GIVINGLI may send you e-mail communications or promotional offers to an email address, through a device (such as mobile device or applications) or through other contact information provided through the
                                GIVINGLI Services. If you do not want to receive such communications from us, please see Section 9. We may contact you using information you have entered into the GIVINGLI Services either recently or in the
                                past regardless of whether you have opted in or out of email marketing messaging.

                                To the extent you participate with interactive features through the GIVINGLI Services such as the social media sites, any personal information that you provide may be published in the manner consistent with
                                the interactive feature. For example, if you tag a photo through Instagram with #GIVINGLI or @GIVINGLIAPP or @GIVINGLI, we may repost that photo under @GIVINGLIAPP or @GIVINGLI.

                                By providing information through the GIVINGLI Services (including through our mobile applications), you authorize us to share information among our family of websites and mobile applications. Further, certain
                                of the GIVINGLI Services (including through our mobile applications) allow for cross application authentication, which means that once you log in to one of the GIVINGLI Services, you may be logged in to any

                                their respective service providers maintain facilities. This means that we may transfer information we collect about you including personal information to entities across borders to another country or
                                jurisdiction. If you are located within the European Union or other jurisdictions with laws governing data storage or processing that are different from United States laws, please be aware that we may
                                transfer information to a country that does not have the same laws. By using the GIVINGLI Services, you expressly consent to: (a) the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which GIVINGLI
                                (or its affiliates) or their respective service providers maintain facilities; and (b) the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.

                                Provider or operating system, the URL of previous GIVINGLI Services you visited, and your IP address. Unless otherwise required by applicable law, GIVINGLI may use and share this information, which does not
                                personally identify you, for any purpose, including sharing with our third party partners, affiliates, agents or service providers for various administrative, analytical and marketing purposes.

                                ​We may use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server, to detect fraud, and to administer the GIVINGLI Services. We may also use your IP address to assist in attempting to identify you when we
                                feel it is necessary to enforce compliance with this Privacy Policy or the Terms of Use, to protect the GIVINGLI Services, systems, information, employees, business partners, service providers, users,
                                customers or others or as may be required by law enforcement.

                            <p>
                                ​Cookies: We may collect information from you by using cookies. A &quot;cookie&quot; is a small text file stored on your computer containing information about you. Cookies help us analyze web traffic, provide
                                user data for a particular webpage, and allow web applications to be adapted for you as an individual. This helps us tailor our operations to your specific needs and preferences by gathering and remembering
                                information about your preferences. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies. If you would prefer to prevent your computer from accepting our cookies, please follow your Internet browser&#x27;s steps
                                for doing so. However, if you do disable cookies, you may not be able to take full advantage of all our online features or access certain sections of our GIVINGLI Services, including the checkout and in-app
                                purchases.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                ​Clear GIFs: We, or our third party partners, affiliates, agents or service providers, may collect information from you by using clear GIFs. A &quot;clear GIF&quot; or graphics interchange format (also known
                                as pixel tags, single pixel GIFs, web beacons or action tags) help us or a third party measure advertising effectiveness. Clear GIFs help us manage content on the GIVINGLI Services by informing us of what
                                content is effective. Further, clear GIFs may be used: (i) in HTML based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients; (ii) to record when products have been ordered through the GIVINGLI
                                Services; and (iii) to track the visitor traffic through the GIVINGLI Services. Among other reasons, these clear GIFs allow us to measure the usage of each of the GIVINGLI Services by our visitors and the
                                effectiveness of certain communications and marketing campaigns. The main differences between a cookie and a clear GIF are that clear GIFs are invisible on a web page and are much smaller.

                                allow certain third parties to collect certain information when you use the GIVINGLI Services. For example, these companies may use non-personal information (e.g., click stream information, browser type, time
                                and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over, hardware/software information, cookie and session ID) and personal information (e.g., IP address) during your visits to GIVINGLI Services in order
                                to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you on third party sites. These parties typically use a cookie or a third party web beacon to collect this information.

                                ​Our Do Not Track Policy: Some third party browsers have a &quot;do not track&quot; feature that lets you tell websites that you do not want to have your online activities tracked. At this time, we do not
                                respond to browser &quot;do not track&quot; signals. To learn more about online behavioral advertising (OBA), please visit the Network Advertising Initiative website (

                                standards. Further, additional disclosures or requests for permission may be presented through the use of such new technologies at the time of such use. For example, you may receive a request from a mobile
                                application to enable sharing of information through your device.

                                latitude and/or longitude) or similar information regarding the location of your mobile device. Location data may convey to us information about how you browse and use the GIVINGLI Services. We may also be
                                able to determine your general geographic location (i.e., city or town and state) through your IP address. You may control whether location data is shared with us through your mobile device, application or
                                browser settings. Some features of the GIVINGLI Services, particularly location-based services, may not function properly if use or availability of location data is impaired or disabled.

                                third parties as a convenience to you. These links are not intended as an endorsement of or referral to the linked third party goods or services. We recommend you carefully read the privacy policy, notices

                                email and value of purchase depending on the type of relationship. For example, if you purchased or use a voucher from a group buying or flash deal website, we may share information regarding the order in
                                which such voucher was redeemed. If you placed an order utilizing an Affiliate link, as described above, we may share information about you or your order with such Affiliate.

                                paid and products ordered) to direct marketing companies for trade or rental purposes. If you prefer to opt-out of the use of your personal information by direct marketing companies for trade or rental

                                ​GIVINGLI Business and Legal / Mergers and Acquisitions: There may be business or legal reasons to disclose personal information. As an example, we may transfer information we have about you to third parties

                                or as part of a corporate reorganization or stock sale or other change in corporate control. If we undergo such a business transition, personal information may be one of the assets that may be shared or

                                ​We use encryption, passwords, and physical security measures to help protect your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. However, it is always possible that third parties will
